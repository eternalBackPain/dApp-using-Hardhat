# dApp using Hardhat

Developing Ethereum smart contracts using the Hardhat framework and testing in the Hardhat Ethereum network. The Hardhat-toolbox plugin is used (https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-toolbox).



Tutorial covers:
- Setting up your Node.js environment for Ethereum development
- Creating and configuring a Hardhat project
- The basics of a Solidity smart contract that implements a token
- Writing automated tests for your contract using Hardhat
- Debugging Solidity with console.log() using Hardhat Network
- Deploying your contract to Hardhat Network and Ethereum testnets

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
